# My Leader Readme

# What’s my job?

My job is to enable high-performing teams to consistently deliver exceptional value.

Simple, but not easy. I'm writing this so you can better understand my unique perspective on how it is done. Everything needs to be adapted, so lots of principles, but I also aim to be specific— and brief. And, as ever— a work in progress.

# Product

All that we build is in service of the product.

- *Full stack teams*— teams that can analyze business processes, drive change, design & build solutions, and evaluate outcomes.
- *Solutioning*— collaboration between product, design and engineering to solve a customer problem with the right scope in a measurable way. Solution owners for initiatives.
- *Swarming*— team collaboration on a small number of high priority goals per sprint. “We’ve tried this and/or *we* can’t do this”. Let’s debug.
- [*Basecamp 6 week cycles*](https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/35-the-six-week-cycle)— the most important ideas here are “what does a 6 week version look like”, and bucketing interrupts. There are ways to adapt this to a more traditional sprint cycle.
- *Measure investment mix—* categorize all work and use a lagging metric to make sure you are actually *spending* your time the way you intend to.
- Enable your engineering team to interact with your customer design partners.

# Culture

I learned a lot of what I know about managing teams from coaching girls softball; and, working at startups, but mostly softball.

- Team is a magic world.
- *Work at the same table*— foundational for both trust and accountability.
    
    The happiest, most effective teams I’ve ever worked on sat at the same table or were *very* collocated. This is not a lost cause in a remote first world. It was hard in the physical world too! I once modified a bunch of cube walls to change the floor plan to emphasize a communal table for people to work at with smaller nooks for individual work and added a couch. It’s *culture hacking* and we can tear down walls in the virtual world too. 
    
- *Say you’re sorry*— I’ve made a lot of mistakes— things I regret in a particular interaction. I apologize as soon as makes sense, sometimes with my team and in the moment. There is no better way to build vulnerability, accountability and trust.
- *Quiet is cool*— so is not quiet, but we are already biased that way. Some of the best hires and top performers on my teams are also quiet powerhouses.
- *Use good judgement and drive to decisions*— think about reversibility, and increasing or decreasing optionality.
- Leadership at all levels.
- No *one* sees what we *all* see. Align on observations before moving to solutions.
- Writing things down for everyone allows for async collaboration and contribution. Obvious, but so often overlooked.
- *Fast feedback*— clear is kind.

# Velocity

I prefer *time to value*. Yes, I know this term has some industry meaning, especially in SaaS.

Writing code is awesome and hard, but there’s so much else that can get in the way on the journey to a high-performing team. Broadly this boils down to: reduce toil to increase time to value.

- High quality metrics are important.
    - My favorite source is a terrific startup— [Span](https://www.linkedin.com/company/getspan).
    - [How To Measure Anything](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ybYBCK9D7MZCcdArB/how-to-measure-anything) is helpful here.
    - Mix of leading/lagging metrics.
    - Be careful: [When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) and [this](https://nemethgergely.com/blog/the-tyranny-of-metrics).
    - Scorecards can be really helpful to track change.
- *De-risk early & often*— reduce uncertainty with data and use spikes to get data.
- *Guardrails let you go fast, safely*— good engineers will absorb gaps with pace. This is usually a good area to look for toil and there’s *a lot* here, but I’ll be brief.
    - Tech/Arch review (where it matters).
    - Quality using as much AI as possible. I like [Meticulous.ai](http://Meticulous.ai) for Web UI and [Mobileboost.io](http://Mobileboost.io) for Mobile.
    - API contracts and testing.
    - Data testing for data products.
    - Reproducible development and verification environments.
    - Safe automated deployment.
    - Telemetry, tracing, data lineage.
    - Anomaly detection is a great final safety net.
- Manage complexity and non-functional work intentionally.
    - Efficient Knowledgebase.
    - Simplify, simplify, simplify.
    - Refine a backlog and have “cooldown” time to focus on it.
- [Coordination headwinds](https://saloni.website/navigating-coordination-headwinds-in-software-organizations-lessons-from-slime-mold-and-game-de84d3e202a2)™— anticipate and recognize them
    - Be intentional about the [dynamics of coordination](https://medium.com/@komorama/on-schelling-points-in-organizations-e90647cdd81b).
    - Organize to remove dependencies as much as humanly possible. [Team Topologies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44135420-team-topologies) is a good framework for org design. Leverage embedding thoughtfully to distribute knowledge.
    - Define team interfaces (only when needed).
- Scope is the hidden drag on time to value.
    - Be ruthless with scope.
    - Question value and assumptions.
- Bucket and reduce interrupts.
- Don’t build something that is already built (unless you have really good reasons to).
- Use low code, no code options.
- Leverage AI everywhere.

# Operations

The word *deliver* does a lot of work in my single sentence about what an Engineering Leader does. A big part of delivery is efficiently managing operations and costs.

- *Know the business*— Cost to serve and OpEx spend can be levers depending on business stage and strategy.
- *Cost monitoring and alerting—* Cloud cost monitoring and accounting for a complex SaaS business is surprisingly challenging. I’ve yet to find great tooling that I would recommend.
- *Leverage spot pricing heavily—* I like [Cast.ai](http://Cast.ai) here for kubernetes workloads. Very few workloads actually need reserved capacity with proper engineering. 
- *Dynamically scale—* Leverage metrics driven scaling. I like [Keda](https://keda.sh/) for kubernetes workloads. Serverless has it’s place, but usually isn’t the right choice for scale.
- *Invest in DevOps—* A few really good DevOps folks can really help the trains run on time.

# About Me

- I “think” using notes and use them extensively. I’m kind of addicted to Notion, but flexible.
- I “open source” my leadership, giving access to what I’m handing off, prioritizing, reviewing, etc..
    - I’ve even done it with my Todo list, but don’t share that broadly now.
- I have natural immunity to group think.
- I have tended towards long tenures in my career. I value a good long-term environment over short-term gain.
- I value location flexibility and remote work at this stage and prioritize when possible.

# Touchstones

- **The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place**. *—George Bernard Shaw*
- The most valuable management skill a person can have is the *ability to produce high-talent teams*. Nothing else even comes close. *—Price Pritchett*
- [What Is Leadership?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYKH2uSax8U)  *—David Marquet*
    
    Intent-Based Leadership starts with rejecting the idea that leadership is for the select few at the top and instead embracing in highly effective organizations, there are leaders at every level.
    
- [Clear is kind](https://brenebrown.com/articles/2018/10/15/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/). Unclear is unkind. *—Brené Brown*
- [If you have more than three priorities, you have no priorities.](https://www.inc.com/kimberly-weisul/jim-collins-good-to-great-in-ten-steps.html)
- Your self-perception is based on what you are *trying* to do. Other's perception of you is based on what they *see* you do.
- Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. *—Mike Tyson*

# A Few More

- Managing up means acknowledging that they, like you, are making decisions based on the best information they *have*. If you think they're making bad decisions, you're not giving them the *right information*.
- The real problem lies not in implementing a new process, but in getting people to hold one another accountable to the process. In the best companies, everyone holds everyone else accountable—regardless of level or position.  *—Crucial Conversations*
- It is a paradoxical but profoundly true and important principle of life that the most likely way to reach a goal is to be aiming not at that goal itself but at some more ambitious goal beyond it. *—Arnold Toynbee*
- Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones. *—Ray Dalio*
- The most important conversations you’ll ever have are the ones you’ll have with yourself. *—David Goggins*
